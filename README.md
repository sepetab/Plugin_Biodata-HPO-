# OntoClick v2.0.1

> Turn your clinical description into a proper ontology term.

OntoClick is a Chrome browser extension used by bio researchers to reference ontology class identifiers and preferred labels.

It uses the [NCBO BioPortal REST API](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/), [HPO Jax](https://hpo.jax.org/webjars/swagger-ui/3.20.9/index.html?url=/api/hpo/docs/), [Pryzm Health CR](https://track.health/api/), [EBI Ontology Lookup Search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/docs/api) and [Neural Concept Recongniser](https://ncr.ccm.sickkids.ca/api_doc/) to fulfil search requests.

OntoClick was prototyped at [Health Hack](https://www.healthhack.com.au/) Sydney Nov 2017 by Dr Andreas Zankl's Team OntoClick and subsequently developed by [LivingryLabs](https://www.livingrylabs.net/). 

OntoClick v2.0.1 was improved, based on initial OntoClick prototype, by Team Zankl (BINF6111) from UNSW.
